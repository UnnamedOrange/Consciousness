# Consciousness

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 28pt;">Are you really conscious?</div>

*Consciousness* is a utility to help you close the windows that you don't need.

## Orientation

- A simple but useful program to save users' precious time.
- A sample C++ project based on Qt, which enables the features of:
  - Separating Qt-related and non-Qt-related codes, which gives more flexibility in license selection.
  - Separating OS-related and non-OS-related codes, which gives the ability to write cross-platform applications while using platform-dependent APIs. In progress.
  - Dynamic language changing thanks to Qt Linguist.
  - Novel codes in C++20 standard.

## Roadmap

- [x] `alpha-1`
  - First release.
- [x] `alpha-2`
  - Documentation: README and comments.
  - New features: alias.
  - Code quality: serialization.
- [ ] `alpha-3`
  - New features: regular expressions, close windows without prompt.
  - Code quality: separating OS-related codes.
- [ ] `0.0.1`
  - Code quality: CI.
